# Railway Deployment Cleanup Guide

## Current Status
- **Working Deployment**: https://web-production-846c5.up.railway.app ✅
- **Failed Deployments**: discerning-empathy, scintillating-endurance, balanced-mindfulness ❌

## Issue Explanation
Railway sometimes creates multiple deployment attempts with random names when:
- Git pushes trigger multiple builds
- Network issues cause retry attempts
- Configuration changes cause redeployments

## How to Clean Up Railway Dashboard

### Step 1: Access Railway Dashboard
1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Sign in to your account
3. You should see multiple projects listed

### Step 2: Identify Your Working Project
- **Keep**: The project with URL `web-production-846c5.up.railway.app`
- **Delete**: Any projects named:
  - discerning-empathy
  - scintillating-endurance  
  - balanced-mindfulness
  - Any other failed deployments

### Step 3: Delete Failed Projects
1. Click on each failed project
2. Go to **Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to **Danger Zone**
4. Click **Delete Project**
5. Confirm deletion

### Step 4: Verify Working Deployment
- Your main app should still be accessible at: https://web-production-846c5.up.railway.app
- Test all functionality (login, guest mode, project creation)

## Prevention Tips
- Avoid multiple rapid git pushes
- Wait for deployments to complete before pushing again
- Monitor Railway dashboard for deployment status

## Your Application Status
✅ **Main deployment working perfectly**
✅ **All features functional**
✅ **Ready for submission**

The failed deployments don't affect your working application or project submission.

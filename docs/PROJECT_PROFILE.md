- Individual portfolio pages with custom URLs
- Admin dashboard for content management
- Responsive web design
- Demo mode for feature exploration

**Excluded:**

- Advanced analytics
- Third-party integrations (initially)

## Target Group Analysis
### Primary Users:
- **Junior Developers**: Need professional portfolios for job applications
- **Freelancers**: Require showcase platforms for client acquisition
- **Students**: Want to display academic and personal projects
- **Career Changers**: Need to demonstrate new skills and projects

### User Needs:
- Easy-to-use content management
- Professional, shareable portfolio URLs

## Risk Assessment
### Technical Risks:
- **Database Performance**: Mitigated by SQLite for development, PostgreSQL for production
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Addressed through Flask-WTF CSRF protection and input validation
- **Scalability**: Designed with user-specific data isolation

### Project Risks:
- **Scope Creep**: Controlled through clear MVP definition
- **Time Constraints**: Managed via iterative development approach
- **Technology Learning Curve**: Mitigated by using well-documented Flask ecosystem

d Risk Assessment

### High Priority Risks
| Risk ID | Risk Description | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy | Contingency Plan |
|---------|------------------|-------------|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| R001 | Database performance degradation with multiple users | Medium | High | Implement database indexing, optimize queries, plan PostgreSQL migration | Use connection pooling, implement caching layer |
| R002 | Security vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, SQL injection) | Medium | High | Use Flask-WTF CSRF protection, SQLAlchemy ORM, input validation | Conduct security audit, implement additional sanitization |
| R003 | Cloud deployment failures or service outages | High | Medium | Test deployment early, have backup hosting options (Heroku, Render) | Maintain local deployment option, document manual deployment |

### Medium Priority Risks
| Risk ID | Risk Description | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy | Contingency Plan |
|---------|------------------|-------------|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| R004 | Browser compatibility issues across different platforms | Medium | Medium | Test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge; use standard web technologies | Implement progressive enhancement, provide browser requirements |
| R005 | Time overrun due to scope creep or technical challenges | Medium | Medium | Maintain strict MVP scope, regular progress reviews | Reduce feature scope, extend timeline if necessary |
| R006 | Third-party dependency conflicts or breaking changes | Low | Medium | Pin dependency versions in requirements.txt | Maintain compatibility matrix, test updates in isolation |

### Low Priority Risks
| Risk ID | Risk Description | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy | Contingency Plan |
|---------|------------------|-------------|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| R007 | Poor user experience leading to low adoption | Low | Low | Conduct usability testing, implement guest mode for trials | Gather user feedback, iterate on design |
| R008 | Documentation gaps affecting maintenance | Low | Low | Maintain documentation alongside code development | Allocate time for documentation review and updates |
